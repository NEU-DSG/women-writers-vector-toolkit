      <h2>The Tool</h2>
      <p>Code for the model querying tool can be found on GitHub at 
        <a href="https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-w2vonline" target="_blank">https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-w2vonline</a>. 
        The tool itself is an <a href="https://shiny.rstudio.com" class="link link-external" target="_blank">RStudio Shiny</a> application 
        developed by Jonathan D. Fitzgerald and Parth Tandel. It uses Benjamin Schmidt’s R package 
        <a href="https://github.com/bmschmidt/wordVectors" class="link link-external" target="_blank">wordVectors</a> 
        to create and query models of words.</p>
      <p>The GitHub repository includes copies of the models, as well as a JSON catalog of those models and instructions
        for running the application yourself.</p>
      
      <h2>Corpora</h2>
      <p>The <a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/texts" target="_blank">Women Writers Online (WWO) corpus</a> 
        represents works published between 1400 and 1850 which were authored, translated, or compiled by women. The 
        corpus is available online to subscribing institutions or individuals. The XML files are freely 
        available on request. For consideration, send an email with a brief description of your research to 
        <a href="mailto:wwp@&#x006E;&#x0065;&#x0075;&#x002E;&#x0065;&#x0064;&#x0075;">wwp@&#x006E;&#x0065;&#x0075;&#x002E;&#x0065;&#x0064;&#x0075;</a>.</p>
      <p>The tool also includes documents from the <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/vwwp/welcome.do;jsessionid=1A51FE9C3891932DC13BA64BD2841FC3" target="_blank">Victorian Women Writers Project</a> (VWWP) and the <a href="https://eebo.chadwyck.com/home" target="_blank">Early English Books Online</a> (EEBO) corpus.</p>
      <p>Each corpus was transcribed and encoded in XML, following the 
        <a href="https://www.tei-c.org/" class="link link-external" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative (TEI)</a> 
        guidelines. For this project, the XML files were then transformed into normalized plain text using 
        <a href="https://github.com/NEU-DSG/wwp-public-code-share/tree/master/fulltext" 
          class="link link-external" target="_blank">XSLT and XQuery scripts</a>.</p>
      
      <h3>Corpus Preparation</h3>
      <p>We transformed the WWO corpus to improve the results of word2vec with XSLT and XQuery. XSLT and XQuery are native programming languages for Extensible Markup Language (XML). XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation) allows us to make programmatic changes to the XML structure of the WWO corpus. XQuery is designed for retrieving and interpreting information. Together, these languages move through the XML tree structures of WWO files and alter the encoding of pre-specified elements.</p>
      <p>For instance, textual instances of abbreviations are expanded within our XML elements.</p>
      <!-- Snapshot example of XML/TEI and transformed text -->
      <p>In addition to transforming the styling of some elements, we also remove elements that skew word embedding results. XQuery removes TEI metadata and data from the file that we produced while marking up the text. It also allows us to extract specific sections of the document using XPath.</p>
      <!-- Full list: ('castList', 'elision', 'figDesc', 'label', 'speaker’) with an example -->
      
      <h3>Corpus Parsing</h3>
      <p>The Women Writers Vector Toolkit provides various models for literary exploration and comparison. We have segmented the WWO corpus into different subsets to create different models. In addition to two models that include every file in the WWO (one with front and back matter and one with only the body content), models are separated into three categories: centuries, publication place, and specific elements.</p>
      <p>The WWO corpus spans more than three centuries from 1526 to 1850. Every file in the corpus contains a canonical date of the text’s first edition. These dates are used to sort and combine plain text files into a single text file with each file containing all documents from a single century, except for the 16th century, which has been merged with the 17th century text file. The 16th and 17th centuries together provide enough words for an accurate model and are approximately the same size as the 18th- and 19th-century models. These files, once modeled, can be used for diachronic studies of literary and cultural change.</p>
      <p>Similarly, the WWO records the place of publication for each file. This information is leveraged in the same way as dates to create single plain text files of documents published inside and outside the United States. These models can be useful for exploring possible language variations across space and cultures.</p>
      <p>Lastly, the WWO allows for word usage across writing styles. Elements representing prose (paragraphs: &lt;p&gt;) and verse (line groups: &lt;lg&gt;) allow the corpus to be crudely partitioned along genre. These models highlight how context inflects word meaning and usage.</p>
      <p>The Python code that parses and creates these datasets is a twofold process. First, the parser opens every file in a directory, looking for the canonical publication date. Once found, it uses the filename to retrieve the clean and regularized text files produced by the XSLT and XQuery preparation. After it has gathered the publication date and the clean text, it writes the text to the text file designated by the file’s date. It repeats this process for publication place and elements.</p>
      <p>We have also created models of the <a href="http://webapp1.dlib.indiana.edu/vwwp/welcome.do;jsessionid=1A51FE9C3891932DC13BA64BD2841FC3" target="_blank">Victorian Women Writers Project</a> (VWWP) and of <a href="https://eebo.chadwyck.com/home" target="_blank">Early English Books Online</a> (EEBO). The VWWP corpus contains all of the body content from their corpus. We have two variants of the VWWP texts: one with Morphadorner applied and one without. The EEBO corpus is designed as a parallel corpus to the WWP. We randomly selected texts from EEBO and then pulled the same number of words from each century. The EEBO corpus approximately mirrors the combined WWP-century corpora.</p>
      
      <h3>Model Testing</h3>
      <p>Once the plain text of each file has been cleaned, normalized, sorted, and combined, the resulting text files can be fed into word2vec to be modeled. We tested the parameters of various word embedding models to choose the best fit for our data. Using 27 pairs of words and determining their cosine similarities, we found that we obtained the best results from a model created with a window size of 6 words, 100 vectors, 10 iterations, and negative sampling set at 15. Models produced from the smallest datasets varied slightly with a negative sampling set at 5.</p>
      <p>With the model parameters in place, we then tested our three processes for regularization: XSLT and XQuery alone, Northwestern University’s Morphadorner, and Morphadorner tuned to be sensitive to Early Modern English vocabularies and spelling practices. We again used the 27 word-pairings and found that the XSLT and XQuery alone produced the best results by a slight amount.</p>
