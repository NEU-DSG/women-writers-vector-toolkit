    <div>
    <p>This glossary is an alphabetized list of terms picked by the <b>[TEAM NAME]</b> Team. These terms have been chosen and defined with the intention of making the website accessible to multiple levels of expertises. </p>
    <dl>
     <dt>Algorithm</dt>
     <dd>The process or set of rules to problem-solve or make a calculation. Usually we input data, the algorithm works on this data in a particular way, and it outputs new data. In this case, we use different code to run algorithms to quantify our text in various ways. The input is the different models from the Women Writers Project and the output is the word vectors.</dd>
      <dt>Code</dt>
      <dd>In the case of this project, code is the program instructions to run an algorithm to collect data.</dd>
      <dt>Corpus/Corpora (plural)</dt>
      <dd>The collection of data.In this case the collection of different texts and information about those texts and editorial choices. A corpus is usually analyzed or manipulated.</dd>
      <dt>Data/Datum</dt>
      <dd>Facts, statistics, or information collected for analysis. Data can come in all shapes and sizes and may look different across disciplines as well as among factions within disciplines.</dd>
      <dt>Digital Humanities</dt>
      <dd> This definition can be very basic or very complex. Some argue baseline definition of digital humanities is the field in which computational skills and tools are used in the humanities disciplines, for things like text analysis, mapping, presentations. Others argue digital humanities is a field for critiquing computational tools and better understanding the social, cultural, and political impacts of these tools.</dd>
      <dt>Documentation</dt>
      <dd>A way of providing official information or evidence to use as a record to understand choices made; documentation is useful for accessibility, transparency, and archiving. In this case, we have documentation about how the code was created, the different choices behind each model of the corpus, and more.</dd>
      <dt>Model</dt>
      <dd>A representation or example of a concept or thing. In this case, we use “models” to refer to the different ways we are representing the Women Writer’s corpus through our choices in what information to extract.</dd>
      <dt>Pedagogy</dt>
      <dd>the method and practice of teaching something – particularly teaching with theories in particular academic subjects. In this case, we will be providing a pedagogical approach to using word vector analysis and textual analysis in the classroom.</dd>
      <dt>Quantitative Method</dt>
      <dd>A way of presenting and studying data through the representation of numbers or analyzing numbers.</dd>
      <dt>R</dt>
      <dd>A programming language and environment used for statistical computing or graphics.</dd>
      <dt>Regularization</dt>
      <dd>A form of regression used to avoid overfitting data, or to reduce the complexity of the model.
      Research Question: A question that drives a research project. Unlike a hypothesis, a research question is an actual question driven by research with a known or unknown answer. Hypotheses are statements about the relationship of things.</dd>
      <dt>TEI</dt>
      <dd>TEI stands for Text Encoding Initiative and is a collaborative XML schema that is used to standardize the digitization of texts. The TEI is a collective or consortium that sets a standard for ways of presenting a text digitally, chiefly in the humanities, social sciences, and linguistics. The WWP uses TEI to encode all their texts and this project uses the TEI-encoded data to create new models and run the word vector algorithm.</dd>
      <dt>Text Base</dt>
      <dd>A text base is similar to a database. Instead of being a group of facts or statistics, the information collected is a set of texts.</dd>
      <dt>Text encoding</dt>
      <dd>Using pieces of texts as a base to mark up or encode parts of it. The Women Writers Project use TEI standards and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) rules for text encoding.</dd>
      <dt>Women Writers Project (WWP)</dt>
      <dd>A long-term research project aiming to bring texts by pre-Victorian women writers out of the archive and make them accessible to a wide audience of teachers, students, scholars, and the general reader.</dd>
      <dt>Women Writers Online</dt> <dd>The texts and authors in the WWP text base available online for use.
      Word Vectors/Embeddings: Word embeddings is the process in which texts are grouped together with numbers and then mapped onto a vector space (word vector). It produces a visual representation of these models and helps to quantify based on distributional properties.</dd>
      <dt>XML</dt>
      <dd>XML stands for eXtensible Markup Language. It is a customizable schema-based language  used to digital information, particularly texts. There are a set of rules to customize XML to your particular dataset that allow for encoding the text so it can be human-readable and computer-readable.</dd>
      <dt>XQuery</dt>
      <dd>A query and functional program that transforms data, usually in XML or similar formats, for other data formats.</dd>
      <dt>XSLT</dt>
      <dd>XSLT stands for eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation. It programming language to transform XML documents into other kinds of documents, like HTML, plain text, or even another XML file.</dd>
