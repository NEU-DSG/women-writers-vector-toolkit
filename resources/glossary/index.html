						<h1>Glossary</h1>
						<p>This glossary is a list of terms selected and defined with the intention of making word embedding models accessible to individuals with multiple levels of expertise. </p>
						<dl>
							<dt>Algorithm</dt>
							<dd>A process or set of rules used to solve a problem or make a calculation. An algorithm may be expressed in structured language such as a computer program, or described in a visualization such as a flowchart. Algorithms are particularly useful for repeatable tasks with multiple steps.</dd>
							<dt>Code</dt>
							<dd>An expression of one or more algorithms. Code is generally written to the standards of a particular programming language. When written in this way, code can be read and its instructions acted upon by computers.</dd>
							<dt>Corpus (Plural: Corpora)</dt>
							<dd>A collection of textual data. A corpus is usually analyzed or manipulated in some fashion.</dd>
							<dt>Data (Singular: Datum)</dt>
							<dd>Facts, statistics, or information collected for analysis. Data can come in all shapes and sizes and may look different across disciplines as well as among groups within disciplines.</dd>
							<!--<dt>Digital Humanities</dt>
							<dd>This definition can be very basic or very complex. Some argue that the baseline definition of digital humanities is the field in which computational skills and tools are used in the humanities disciplines, for things like text analysis, mapping, presentations. Others argue digital humanities is a field for critiquing computational tools and better understanding the social, cultural, and political impacts of these tools.</dd> SC: I don't think that we need this and I think it's potentially distracting.-->
							<dt>Documentation</dt>
							<dd>A way of providing information about the choices made in a project; documentation is useful for accessibility, transparency, and archiving. On this site, we have documentation about how the code was implemented, how corpora were selected and prepared, and more.</dd>
							<dt>Model</dt>
							<dd>A representation of a concept or thing. When created for analysis, models are distillations of available data. Models are always lossy compared to the original versions—they reduce complexity in order to aid understanding. Because of this, models must be constructed carefully, so that loss is minimized in areas where the model needs to be representative. For this project, we used textual models (XML representations of actual books) to create word embedding models.</dd>
							<!--<dt>Pedagogy</dt>
							<dd>The method and practice of teaching something – particularly teaching with theories in particular academic subjects. In this case, we will be providing a pedagogical approach to using word vector analysis and textual analysis in the classroom.</dd>-->
							<dt>Quantitative Method</dt> <!-- Do we need this? -->
							<dd>A way of presenting and studying data through the representation or analysis of numbers.</dd>
						  <dt>Programming Language</dt>
						  <dd>A strictly-defined set of syntactical rules, used when writing or executing code. The term “programming language” may also be used more broadly to describe a language’s “implementations,” or, programs which read, validate, compile, or execute code.</dd>
							<dt>R</dt>
							<dd>A programming language and environment used for statistical computing and graphics.</dd>
							<!--<dt>Regularization</dt>
							<dd>A form of regression used to avoid overfitting data, or to reduce the complexity of the model.</dd>-->
					<!--	  <dt>Research Question</dt>
						  <dd>A question that drives a research project. Unlike a hypothesis, a research question is an actual question driven by research with a known or unknown answer. Hypotheses are statements about the relationship of things.</dd>-->
							<!--<dt>Schema</dt>-->
						  <dt>TEI</dt>
							<dd>Stands for “<a href="http://www.tei-c.org/" target="_blank">Text Encoding Initiative</a>.” TEI is a collaborative XML schema that is used to standardize the markup of textual documents. <!--The TEI Consortium sets a standard for ways of digitally modeling humanities and social science research materials.--> The Women Writers Project uses TEI to encode the texts in WWO and this project uses models trained on TEI-encoded files that have been selectively transformed into plain text.</dd>
							<!--<dt>Textbase</dt>
							<dd><!-\-A textbase is similar to a database.-\->A collection of textual documents which may have use as data.</dd>-->
						<!--	<dt>Text encoding</dt>
							<dd>Using pieces of texts as a base to mark up or encode parts of it. The Women Writers Project use TEI standards and XML (eXtensible Markup Language) rules for text encoding.</dd>-->
						<!--	<dt><a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/">Women Writers Project</a> (WWP)</dt>
							<dd>A long-term research project aiming to bring texts by pre-Victorian women writers out of the archive and make them accessible to a wide audience of teachers, students, scholars, and the general reader.</dd>-->
							<dt>Word Embedding Models</dt> <!-- Needs to be fixed -->
						  <dd>Word embedding models are a technique from the fields of machine-learning and natural language processing
						  	in which the words in large textual datasets are represented numerically and mapped to vectors. Essentially,
						  	word embedding models allow for a spatial understanding of the words in a corpus, such that one can calculate
						  	the proximity of particular words (closer words are those used in more similar contexts) as well as their
						  	positioning along paths, or vectors (words on the same vector are those with similar relationships between each other). </dd>
							<dt>XML</dt>
							<dd>Stands for “eXtensible Markup Language.” Like HTML, XML uses tags<!-- define tags? --> to layer meaning and hierarchical relationships onto text. Unlike HTML, XML has no defined tag names, and is in fact customizable. Anyone can define their own flavor of XML; the only constraint is that XML documents must be well-formed (that is, a document has only one outermost tag, and all tags are closed). TEI is one such flavor of XML, as is XSLT.</dd>
							<dt>XQuery</dt>
							<dd>A programming language used to obtain and manipulate data from XML. XQuery shares many of the features of XSLT, but XQuery code is not written in XML.</dd>
							<dt>XSLT</dt>
							<dd>Stands for “eXtensible Stylesheet Language Transformation.” XSLT is a programming language used to transform XML documents into other kinds of documents, such as HTML, plain text, or even another XML file. XSLT code is expressed through XML.</dd>
