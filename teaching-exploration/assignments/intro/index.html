						Interface</h1>
						<p>By Cara Marta Messina</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This classroom-based activity will introduce students to the WWP’s <a href="http://lab.wwp.northeastern.edu/wwvt/">Word Vector
					Interface</a> and enable them to begin exploring larger thematic questions
					about the texts in <a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/index.html">Women Writers Online</a>. The activity can serve as a starting point for incorporating WWO, word vectors, and text analysis in the classroom.
				</p>
				<h2>Methodology</h2>
				<p>For this preliminary case study, I  ran various inquiries using the full WWO corpus model to look for major trends or interesting patterns in the corpus. From that, I picked the top two interesting results from my research. My hope is that with further case studies and with the formalization of the interface, I can revisit this analysis, run it on more models with various operations, and determine if my below analyses and hypotheses seem to hold up. The purpose of this piece is to exemplify the basic uses of word2vec analysis.    
				</p>
				<p>This activity will be broken down into several parts. First, students will be guided by the instructor through a series of searches and discussion questions. Using the first part as a framework, the second part will ask learners to work in groups and conduct some exploratory analysis with word vectors.
				</p>
				<p>Instructors can then broaden the scope of this activity by asking groups to form
					a theory for how their explorations reflect some characteristics of the texts in WWO; students can then examine the texts in the WWO collection to refine their theories and consider how close and distinct reading styles shape our understanding of early women’s writing.
				</p>
				<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
				<p>This activity will enable students to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Gain a basic understanding for how word vector models work.
					</li>
					<li>Familiarize themselves with WWO corpus and the Word Vector Interface.
					</li>
					<li>Explore how the relationship between words in a corpus tie into larger cultural themes.
					</li>
					<li>Reflect on the differences between close reading and text analysis at scale.
					</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Activities</h2>
				<p>This ten minute classroom-based activity will break down into two parts: the first part will be guided by the instructor based on a series of interesting searches and the instructor will ask thematic questions based on these searches; using the first part as a framework, the second part will ask learners to begin making discoveries about the corpus and think about potential research projects to pursue.  
				</p>
				<h3>Introductory Exploration</h3>
				<p>Using the Women Writers Word Vector Interface, try these searches and compare the results:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>On the “Home” function to query “queen” and “king” using the “WWO Corpus” model and compare results.</li>
					<li>Use the “Operations” function to query  “queen” + “king” in the “WWO Corpus” and compare results to the previous results from the “Home” function.</li>
					<li>Bonus: What happens when you search “king” and “queen” plus one of their top ten closest words? For example, consider the difference between “queen” + “kingdome” and “king” + “kingdome.”</li>
				</ul>
				<h3>Discovery Activity</h3>
				<p>Now, working in small groups, go to the “Clusters” function. The clustering
					function randomizes clusters of words that are closely associated in that
					particular model’s vector space. We recommend continuing to use the “WWO
					Corpus,” since this is the entire WWO corpus. You can hit “Reset” to discover more clusters if none of the initial clusters are interesting to your group. For more information on the difference between
					“Clusters” and other functions, <a href="../clusters/index.html">we highly recommend going through this activity
					and explanation of “Clusters.”</a>
				</p>
				<p>As a group, select a cluster and then begin using the different search functions to learn more about the relationship between words in this cluster. For example, one cluster may read “beauty, youth, virtue, delight, pure, etc.,” and you might explore how the words associated with “beauty” change when you add or subtract other terms:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Basic query: “beauty”</li>
					<li>Operations (Addition): “beauty” + “virtue”</li>
					<li>Operations (Subtraction): “beauty” - “pure” or “beauty” - “virtue”</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Consider the terms that result from the queries that your group tries: which results surprise you? which match with what you were expecting to find? which seem especially interesting or difficult to explain? Try to develop an explanation for the associations that you are discovering between words and make a list of the terms that you think are particularly important for your theory.</p>
				<h3>Usage Investigation</h3>
				<p>Now that you have a list of terms and an idea about how they are associated with each other, you can begin investigating their use in the Women Writers Online collection to see how your theory might change when you look at these terms in context. You can click on each word to see search results in the WWO interface. Depending on the words your group chooses, you might find that there are too many results to read each one; for example, the word “beauty” appears in almost 300 texts, so you may want to combine search terms or refine your results by genre or time period. In looking through WWO, you might also discover additional terms that you will want to investigate with the word vector tool.
				</p>
				<p>After you have explored the contexts for the terms on your list, consider whether the theory you developed using the Word Vector Interface is consistent with what you are seeing in the WWO texts. If not, can you develop a new explanation for what you have discovered in both the WWO interface and the Word Vector Interface? Be prepared to share your revised theory and several searches in both the WWO interface and the word vector exploration tool with the rest of the class.
				</p>
				<h3>Comparing close reading results to WVI results
				</h3>
				<p>It is always recommend to encourage students to compare their different results to the actual excerpts from the texts.</p>
				<p>Using one of the queried terms (by clicking on the word), ask students to close-read some of the excerpts from the actual text when this term appears and come up with a list of other words that might appear in similar contexts based on their close readings. How does their list compare to the WVI’s list?
				</p>
				<p>For example, when “man” is queried in the Basic function in the WWO Corpus, “fool” is one of the top results. When reading through where “man” appears in the actual WWO texts, though, how often do students’ analysis of the text lead them to believe “man” is associated with “fool?”  What other words might the students believe appear in similar contexts based on their analysis of the excerpts? The aim for this bonus section is to discuss the difference between how people typically read texts (close reading) vs. how computers typically “read” texts (through algorithms and modeling patterns in the texts).
