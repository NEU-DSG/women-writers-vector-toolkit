						Using the Women Writers Word Vector Interface</h1>
						<p>By Cara Marta Messina</p>
					</header>
					<h2>Description</h2>
					<p>This classroom-based activity will introduce students to the corpora of different
						centuries using the <a
						href="http://lab.wwp.northeastern.edu/wwvt/">Women Writers Word
					Vector Interface (WVI)</a>–available through the Women Writers Vector
					Toolkit(WWVT)–and enable them to begin exploring larger thematic questions about
					the centuries in <a href="https://wwp.northeastern.edu/wwo/index.html">Women
					Writers Online</a>. The activity can serve as a starting point for incorporating WWO, literary century comparison, word vectors, and text analysis in the classroom.
				</p>
				<p>This in-class activity will provide an opportunity for learners to explore the corpus and do comparative analyses across women writers in the 16th+17th, 18th, and 19th centuries. This type of activity will be useful in courses that revolve around women writers in the 16th+17th, 18th, and/or 19th centuries. It is always recommended to use the results from the WWVT to compare to the excerpts from the actual texts. 
				</p>
				<p>This activity will be broken down into several parts. First, students will use the “Cluster” function to discover word vector clusters in one century’s corpus to discover different clusters. Next, the students will use their discovery to begin querying the corpus. If there is time, the students will then conduct a comparative analysis by comparing different century corpora’s results. The scope of this activity varies around the investment of time; it is recommended to allot at least an hour for meaningful exploration, analysis, and discussion. 
				</p>

				<h2>Learning Goals</h2>
				<p>This activity will enable students to:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Gain a basic understanding of the Women Writers Word Vector Interface, particularly the difference between “Clustering” queries and “Basic” queries.

					</li>
					<li>Examine how particular words are used across the 16/17th, 18th, and 19th
					centuries.</li>
					<li>Use the “Compare” function to conduct a comparative analysis between two centuries’ corpora. </li>
					<li>Explore how the relationship between words in corpus tie to larger cultural values in a particular century.</li>
				</ul>
				<h2>Activities</h2>
				<p>There are two major activities: the first looks at the results from a specific century, while the second activity looks at the results from other centuries to conduct a comparative analysis. The second activity is an extension of the first activity. </p>
				<h3>Activity 1: Clustering by Century</h3>
				<p>For this activity, your students will explore the “Clusters” results for the
					century model of choice (WWO 17th, WWO 18th, or WWO 19th). The “Clusters”
					results are 10 randomized clusters from your model of choice. Every time you
					click “Reset Clusters,” you get a new randomized set of clusters. For more
					information about "Clusters" results and "Basic" results, <a
					href="../clusters/index.html">we encourage you to
				check out this activity.</a></p>

				<p>Because clusters are randomized points on the corpus model, they provide more of a window into the word vector model rather than more concrete results. Introduce the Clustering results as a way in for your students to get familiar with how these models represent the specific century’s corpus. 
				</p>
				<p>For example, if the course being taught is an 17th century women writers course, ask students to use the “WWO 17th” model in the left hand column of the toolkit and then click “Clusters.” Have students search through the clusters, continuing to refresh them until they find a particular cluster that interests them. You might recommend that they take screenshots of these clusters to remember interesting results to remember for future use of the WWVT. 
				</p>
				<p>Once your students have begun to explore the corpus model using the Clusters results, encourage them to take interesting clusters and use the “Basic” function to explore different words. As shown in the above visual, students might be interested in the word “natural” and how the vector corpus model has seen other words that are most similar to “natural.” Ask students to have a small-group or classroom discussion about the results of the “Basic” function for the particular words they’re interested in. Focus on results that are surprising or expected; for example, you might expect “ray” to be close to “light,” but what about “empyrean” (16th result). As these conversations about results happen, encourage students to think about what these general results may say about the century corpus.</p>
				<p>The final recommended step is to have students then click on words of interest. The WVI will show results of each time the word appears in the actual excerpts of the texts across the corpus. Ask students to compare how the WVI results compare to the results from the actual texts. Again, using “light” as an example how do the results of words like “light” in WVI compare to the results of “light” in excerpts from the texts. 
				</p>
				<h3>Activity 2: Century Comparison Using Clustering</h3>
				<p>If you wish to continue using the WWVT to do century comparisons, encourage students to use their results of interest from the above discussion on other century models. If the students were querying “light” on the 17th century model, how do the results differ on the 18th and 19th century models? Use the “Compare” function to look at the different between two models. 
				</p>
				<p>By using these different results to do a comparative analysis, you and your students can have a larger discussion about the different results that appear across the century models. Choose particular searches that interest you and your students and ask students to compare the models.
