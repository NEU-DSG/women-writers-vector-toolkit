							<p style="text-align:justify"> The Women Writers Vector Toolkit was mostly created by graduate students at Northeastern University. The project has taken a handful of years to come to fruition, and in that time the project has morphed and changed. This most recent summer of work produced this website. To incorporate the strengths of each team members into the project, we divided the team into three groups to work simultaneously throughout the summer.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Corpus Team</b> included most, if not all, of the graduate students found on the <a href="team-members.html"> team members page </a>. This group focused on the model creation, testing, and application side of the WWVT.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Infrastructure Team</b> worked on the creation and upkeep of the tool we initially had on a Shiny App, and were the ones who moved the documentation and tool to the current site for this project.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Pedagogy Team</b> created most of the documentation for the website, the wireframe for the website, and the assignments and case studies that are found here. They particularly focused on creating a narrative for this tool, and supporting readings and information, so it can be accessed by a wide range of scholars, educators, students, and researchers.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">As it can be seen on the <a href="team-members.html">Team Members page</a>, most of the members of this project worked in multiple team groups. This allowed for crossover of ideas, better communication, and smoother transitions with the workload as the project progressed. The Women Writers Vector Toolkit aimed to have a collaborative, inclusive, and enriching environment for its members as the project grew.</p>
