                    <h1>Query Exploration Notebook</h1>
                    <p>This document offers a structure you might use for keeping track of your
                        preliminary results with the various query options as you explore your
                        models. You can copy-paste relevant results into each section below, along
                        with any initial notes on what seems significant or worth further
                        exploration. If you are working with multiple models, make sure to keep
                        track of which model you're using for any results you include! </p>
                    <b>Contents</b>: 
                        <p>Clusters</p>
                        <p>“Closest to” Queries

                    <h3>Clusters</h3><p>In this section, record any clusters that are of interest,
                        as well as your notes on what you think they might be showing or notes on
                        any terms the clusters suggest you might want to query. </p>
                    <h3>“Closest to” Queries</h3><p>Use this space to record the results of queries
                        for single terms. Make sure to include the term! What were the most
                        significant neighbors (with the highest cosine similarity) and what was the
                        cosine similarity? </p>
                    <h3>Addition Queries</h3><p>Use this section to record the results for queries
                        that use the addition function, which looks at the combined vectors for
                        multiple terms (term 1 + term 2). </p>
                    <h3>Subtraction Queries</h3><p>Use this space to record the results for queries
                        that use the subtraction operation, which looks at the space between two
                        terms—that is, the terms that are closest to one term when the contexts for
                        the second term are subtracted (term 1 - term 2). </p>
                    <h3>Analogies</h3><p>Use this section to record the results of queries for the
                        analogy function, which subtracts the contexts associated with one word from
                        another then adds a third term (term 1 - term 2 + term A). This will
                        generate results that associate with the difference between the first two
                        terms plus the contexts of the third term. </p>
