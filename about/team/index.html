							<div class="host-element">
							</div>

							<p style="text-align:justify"> The Women Writers Vector Toolkit was created by a group of
							    faculty members, staff, and undergraduate and graduate students at Northeastern University. For a full list
							    of these members, <a href="team-members.html">visit the team members page</a>. The project has
							    taken a handful of years to come to fruition, and in that time the project has morphed
							    and changed. To incorporate the strengths of each team members into the project, we
							    divided the team into three groups to work simultaneously throughout the project during
							    Summer and Fall 2018.</p>
						    
						    <p style="text-align:justify">Most of the members of this project worked in multiple team groups. This allowed for crossover of ideas, better communication, and smoother transitions with the workload as the project progressed. The Women Writers Vector Toolkit aimed to have a collaborative, inclusive, and enriching environment for its members as the project grew.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Corpus Team</b> included most, if not all, of the
							    graduate students who worked in Summer and Fall 2018. This group focused on the model creation, testing, and application side of the WWVT.</p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Infrastructure Team</b> worked on the creation and
							    upkeep of the original version of the Word Vector Interface held on a Shiny App. The
							    infrastructure team then built the WWVT toolkit website as well as the new <a href="http://lab.wwp.neu.edu/wwvt/">Word Vector
							    Interface.</a></p>

							<p style="text-align:justify">The <b>Pedagogy Team</b> created most of the text for the website, the wireframe for the website, and the assignments and case studies that are found here. They particularly focused on creating a narrative for this tool, and supporting readings and information, so it can be accessed by a wide range of scholars, educators, students, and researchers.</p>
